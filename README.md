# Python_API_Challenge_Final

Observations: Among the 560 Cities observed in this analysis of weather, the following are observations: 

1. Current temperatures from both hemispheres appear to correlate with the latitude in that the lower the latitude, the higher the temperature. 

2. This also showed to be the case with the Maximum temperatures recorded in this analysis with those cities located in the Northern Hemisphere, However, the correlation between Maximum temperatures and latitude in the cities observed in the Southern Hemisphere was not strong. 

3. Humidity and latitude did not appear to have a strong correlation in either hemisphere. 

Please see final_cities_weather.csv for the data on the 560 observed cities
